# Live WebGIS

Welcome to the **Live Web GIS** repository! This project provides example HTML files to demonstrate how to visualize geographic data using different types of geospatial features such as points, lines, and polygons on a map. These files utilize **MAPID Maps** as the basemap and **Maplibre GL JS** for rendering and interacting with the map.

## 🗂 Project Structure

This project contains the following example files:

- [**`map.html`**](/map.html): A basic map centered at a specific location with zoom controls.
- [**`point.html`**](/point.html): Demonstrates how to add a point marker to the map.
- [**`line.html`**](/line.html): Shows how to draw a polyline (e.g., a road or path) on the map.
- [**`polygon.html`**](/polygon.html): Displays a polygon (e.g., an area or region) on the map.

## 📌 Requirements

To view and run the example files, you'll need:
- A modern web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).
- An internet connection (for loading MAPID Maps tiles).

## 🛠 Installation

You can run the examples locally by following these steps:

#### How to Use CodePen for Online Editing

1. **Go to [CodePen](https://codepen.io)** – Open the online editor.
2. **Copy and Paste the Code** – Copy the code from the example HTML files and paste it into the appropriate sections on CodePen (HTML, CSS, JS).
3. **View in Preview** – See the result in the preview section of CodePen.
4. **Modify the Code** – Feel free to change the code to suit your needs and see the live updates in the preview.
5. **Happy Mapping! 🌍** – Enjoy customizing and experimenting with your Web GIS project!
